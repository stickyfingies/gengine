1. Might've broken Submodules via rm -rf
2. TypeScript --> DukTape

Today, the FFI is defined in three places.
1. core/core.h exposes the C++ API that can be called by loading the binary.
2. core/ffi/*.cpp expose that API to JavaScript in some useful capacity.
3. examples/cmake/emscripen.cmake must explicitly label each funciton from core.h.

TODO: add typescript declarations for the core.h functions.
