1. Might've broken Submodules via rm -rf
2. TypeScript --> DukTape

Today, the FFI is defined in three places.
1. core/core.h exposes the C++ API that can be called by loading the binary.
2. core/ffi/*.cpp expose that API to JavaScript in some useful capacity.
3. examples/cmake/emscripen.cmake must explicitly label each funciton from core.h.

TODO: add typescript declarations for the core.h functions.

Okay so we have (A) an engine (B) a web-compile tool for engine + apps

Apps depend on the engine.
The engine must be built for emscripten, which has complicated build infrastructure requirements.
The games must be built for emscripten, ditto.
A tool compiles X/cpp into X/wasm where X is one of {engine, game}.

REMOVE the CMakeLists.txt calling_into examples/CMakeLists.txt dependency.
Instead, have examples/ call into (engine, web-compile).
