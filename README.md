A hobby real-time 3D simulation with physics, user input, and graphics.

Getting Started
---

Download the project using git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stickyfingies/gengine.git
chmod +x ./build.sh
```

Build the project to create an executable.

```sh
./build.sh
```

Finally, launch the app!

```sh
./dist/bin/gengine
```

#### Build Script Options

- `-i` or `--install` will forcefully re-install dependencies.
- `-w` or `--watch` automatigally compiles C++ files when they change.

Architecture

    Asset --> Matrix & Geometry & Texture

    Geometry --> Collidable & Renderable

    Texture --> Descriptor[Material]

    Matrix --> Collidable

    Collidable & Renderable & Descriptor --> GameObject
```

Gengine uses the [Asset Importer Library](https://assimp.org/) to pull geometry and texture data from static asset files.

The geometry is passed into the physics engine to create a physically simulable representation of that shape.

The geometry and the texture are passed into the rendering engine to create a structure that can be rendered on the GPU.

Finally, the culmination of these are used to create a cohesive "game object" that is both visible and tangible.
